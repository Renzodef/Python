"""
More useful special sequences are \d, \s, and \w.
These match digits, whitespace, and word characters respectively.
In ASCII mode they are equivalent to [0-9], [ \t\n\r\f\v], and [a-zA-Z0-9_].
In Unicode mode they match certain other characters, as well. For instance,
\w matches letters with accents.
Versions of these special sequences with upper case letters -
\D, \S, and \W - mean the opposite to the lower-case versions.
For instance, \D matches anything that isn't a digit.
